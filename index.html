                    <p>Programming is the process of creating instructions that a computer can execute to perform a specific task or set of tasks. It involves writing code in a programming language, which is then compiled or interpreted by the computer. Programming languages include C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript, among many others. There are many different types of programming, including web development, mobile app development, game development, and data science. Each type of programming requires a different skill set and knowledge of specific tools and libraries.</p>

                <div class="text_field">
                    <p>Development encompasses a wide range of activities, including software development, web development, game development, and mobile app development, as well as other areas such as product development, research and development, and infrastructure development.
                    It also includes project management, testing, and quality assurance, as well as documentation and maintenance of the final product.
                    It often involves a team of people with different skills, including programmers, designers, project managers, and QA professionals. The development process often involves the use of specific tools and technologies, as well as a defined methodology for managing the project.
